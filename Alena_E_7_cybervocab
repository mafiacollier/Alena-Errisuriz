Tell a story about explaining a Phishing attempt. Who is doing it? to whom? why? Is it recognized? why or why not?
~ A Phishing Tale- Kyle and John were just getting home from an exsausting day and were just ariving home.
  John suggested that they just go to just go to sleep but Kyle insisted that they check their emails for tommorrow's plan.
  But when they opened up their email they noticed that one email seem out of place. When the opened it up they saw that it said that they
  were going to be evicted and that they needed to put into their banking account information to stop the eviction. 
  Kyle started to get worried that they would have to leave their new home and so did John until John started to look closer into the email.
  When John looked up the 'said' company information from the email online he found out that the company didn't even exist, and that other
  people have recived this email and it turned out to be some scam. As soon as he finished reading he reasured Kyle that they wouldn't be 
  evicted and that it was just someone trying to scam them. They deleted the email.
  Maybe a nap was a good idea.
